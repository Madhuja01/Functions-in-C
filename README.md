# Functions-in-C
Objective  In this challenge, you will learn simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a bunch of statements grouped together. A function is provided with zero or more arguments, and it executes the statements on it. Based on the return type, it either returns nothing (void) or something. Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  a += b is equivalent to a = a + b; Task  Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.  Note  There is not built in max function in C. Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. int max(x, y) that returns the greater of the two values.  Input Format  Input will contain four integers -  , one on each line.  Output Format  Print the greatest of the four integers. Note: I/O will be automatically handled.  Sample Input  3 4 6 5 Sample Output  6
